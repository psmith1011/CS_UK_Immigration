        ### Those Affected

        **Target Groups:**
        - Individuals contemplating immigration among multiple country options, assisting in decision-making about where they might have the best opportunities.
        - Organizations, policymakers, and researchers interested in immigration trends, policy impacts, and integration processes.

        ## Potential Impact

        **Benefits of the Model:**
        - Provides a decision-support tool for potential immigrants evaluating their options, offering insights into the likelihood of successful immigration processes.
        - Enhances policymaking with data-driven insights, allowing for the formulation of more effective and transparent immigration policies.
        - Contributes societal value by deepening the understanding of immigration dynamics, which can improve integration strategies and overall policy decisions impacting immigrants.

        ## Summary

        - We have combined data from 15 Excel files sourced from the UK government, encompassing over 1.5 million rows and 47 columns featuring strings, floats, and integers.
        - This comprehensive dataset covers various aspects of immigration and citizenship, providing insights into trends and patterns.
        - These datasets cover various timeframes and categories, with some files sharing similar columns while others span different date ranges, from 2001 to 2023.

As of 2021, the population of foreign-born habitants in the UK has risen to 9.5M, ~14% of the total population. 

Given the limited land space in the UK, the ongoing increase in population density might raise challenges related to infrastructure, housing, and public services. The UK has a limited amount of space available at ~250,000 square km. To put it in perspective, Canada, one of the largest countries in the world by landmass, is ~10 million square km.

The steady rise in the population born abroad in the UK suggests that immigration will continue to play a crucial role in the country's demographic dynamics. These factors necessitate continued attention and effective policy-making to manage the implications of a growing and increasingly diverse population.
