## Exploring Global and Cultural Origins

## Questions to Get You Thinking:

### #1: What percentage of the global population lives outside their country of birth? How does the UK compare?

### #2: Where do fish and chips come from?

### #3: The British are known for their tea. Where did tea originate from?


## Answers:

### #1: 3.6%

Usually people guess much higher. The fact is that there are many closed off countries than the average person expects, especially those from North America or Western Europe. 

The UK, with its rich history of immigration, stands as a prime example of a diverse and multicultural society shaped significantly by its immigrant population.

### #2: Jewish Refugees from Portugal

2: The Origins of Fish and Chips

 Fish and chips, a quintessential British dish, surprisingly has its roots elsewhere. Introduced by Jewish refugees from Portugal in the 16th century, this dish became a national staple in the UK. The refugees brought the tradition of frying fish, which later merged with chips (fries), a popular food among the working class in the UK. The fusion has become a beloved symbol of British food culture.

### #3: East Asia (mostly China)

3: The British Tea Tradition

Although tea is synonymous with British culture, it originally comes from East Asia, primarily China. It was introduced to Britain in the 17th century by the East India Company and has since become a deeply ingrained part of British culture, influencing social habits and becoming a national symbol.

### Population of the United Kingdom 1971-2021

|                | 1971  | 1981  | 1991  | 2001  | 2011  | 2021  |
|----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| All People     | 52.6M | 53.6M | 54.9M | 57.1M | 63.3M | 67.0M |
| Born Abroad    | 3.2M  | 3.4M  | 3.8M  | 4.9M  | 8.0M  | 9.5M |
| % T            | 5.1%  |  6.3%  | 6.9%  | 8.6% | 12.6%  | 14.1% |
| % Δ Decade     | 24.0%  | 7.5%  | 11.8%  | 27.7% | 63.0% | 18.6% |

The population of the UK has risen to 9.5M, as of 2021, which amounts to ~14% of the total population. 

Given the limited land space in the UK, the ongoing increase in population density might raise challenges related to infrastructure, housing, and public services. The UK has a limited amount of space available at ~250,000 square km. To put it in perspective, Canada, one of the largest countries in the world by landmass, is ~10 million square km.

The steady rise in the population born abroad in the UK suggests that immigration will continue to play a crucial role in the country's demographic dynamics. These factors necessitate continued attention and effective policy-making to manage the implications of a growing and increasingly diverse population.

### UK Immigration Costs are Rising

Like many G7 nations like Canada, the cost of immigration, both illegal, and legal, is rising. The United Kingdom, the focus of this study, is having a historic rise in the cost of its asylum system, mainly due to "under enormous and unsustainable pressure due to the challenges of the pandemic and significant increase in small boat crossings."

Here is a press release from the UK Home Office, aka Home Department, (department of the British Government), which is responsible for immigration, security, and law and order.


    Home Office news team, 14 April 2022
    
    Home Office statistics released in February 2022 showed that 28,526 migrants crossed the Channel in 2021- up from 299 in 2018. Almost all claim asylum.

    The United Kingdom has legal obligations under ECHR and the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act to provide asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute, with accommodation and other support whilst their claim for asylum is being considered.

    The current asylum system is costing the taxpayer £1.5 billion a year [annual budget of £10.8 billion], the highest amount in over two decades.

    And the severe pressure on the system means claims from those in genuine need of protection are taking too long to process and is taking away from resources to support people through safe and legal routes to the UK.

    Before the pandemic and the rise in small boat crossings, destitute asylum seekers would be provided with accommodation sourced from the rental housing sector.

    The sharp increase in crossings and the pandemic has led to approximately 37,000 destitute migrants and those on resettlement schemes being accommodated in hotels, costing the taxpayer £4.7 million every day.

    The pandemic significantly impacted the government’s ability to remove people with no right to be in the UK.

    As we work to reform the broken and outdated system, we must ensure we have sufficient capacity to meet our statutory duty to provide accommodation to those in need of our support.

    It is only controlled immigration through safe and legal routes that allows us to make generous offers of sanctuary, while managing pressures on public services, with the proper support people need to rebuild their lives, integrate and thrive.

    The New Plan for Immigration will reform the asylum system, enabling the government to support those in genuine need while preventing abuse of the system and deterring illegal entry to the UK.
