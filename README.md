**Project Overview**
-----------------------
**Problem Area**  
o	Area of Interest: Immigration and asylum seekers in western europe or north america, over a 10+ year period  
o	Is there a way to use historical data to predict the possibility of someone applying for citizenship/refugee/asylum status?  
o	Challenges: Understanding trends, patterns, and factors influencing immigration and asylum-seeking behaviors over time. Addressing issues   related to integration, policy effectiveness, and societal impact.  

**Those Affected**  
o	Individuals who want to immigrate to select countries. Maybe they have a few to choose from and it is difficult to figure out which would have the best odds. With the modelâ€™s help that can know whether it is worth the effort. This could also include organizations, policymakers, and researchers interested in understanding immigration dynamics, policy evaluation, and societal integration  
o	Benefits: Could provide assistance to people that are unsure on making one of their most important life decisions, by taking everything and moving to another country. Also improved decision-making and better policy formulation   
o	Societal value: Enhanced understanding of immigration dynamics can lead to more informed policy decisions, improved integration efforts, and better societal outcomes.  
o	Quantification: Potential impacts can include economic benefits from optimized immigration policies and improved cultural diversity. 

**Summary**

We have combined x excel sheets from the UK gov' for more than 1M rows. We began with ~350K with one spreadsheet.

**Flowchart**

1. Data Collection
  - Obtained 15 seperate xls files from an offical UK government website(1)
  - These original filenames are:
    - 1) asylum-appeals-lodged-datasets-mar-2023(1)  
    - 2) asylum-applications-awaiting-decision-datasets-sep-2023  
    - 3) asylum-applications-datasets-sep-2023(1)  
    - 4) asylum-seekers-receipt-support-datasets-sep-2023  
    - 5) citizenship-datasets-sep-2023  
    - 6) detention-datasets-sep-2023  
    **- 7) entry-clearance-visa-outcomes-datasets-sep-2023**  
    - 8) extensions-datasets-sep-2023  
    - 9) migration-study-sponsorship-datasets-sep-2023  
    - 10) migration-work-sponsorship-datasets-sep-2023  
    - 11) occupation-visas-datasets-sep-2023  
    - 12) outcome-analysis-asylum-applications-datasets-jun-2022  
    **13) returns-datasets-sep-2023**  
    - 14) settlement-datasets-sep-2023  
        
  - Some of the files have similar columns. Others have different date ranges. For example, some go back to 2001, moving to 2023. Others are 2010-2023, 2014-2023, or shortest at 2021-2023. These have been filtered to 'Annual' and 'Quarterly' directories (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4), and filtered again in those yearly ranges noted above.  
  
  - Most relevant xls files were linked together. These are mapped out below:  
    - entries-clean(7) <-> returns-clean(13) <->

    returns #1 -> entries #2 -> asylum #3-> grants #4 ->  
    
asylum_applications #5 -> applications_jobs #6  

From oldest read data to new 1-2-3-4-5-6, data is pasted on top, so it is 6-5-4-3-2-1 unfiltered.



  - The remaining were dropped.
